# BBIY (Big Blue Is You)

It's like Baba is You, but Aggies (and not as good :P)

Most artwork is from the initial game, as found [here](https://www.spriters-resource.com/pc_computer/babaisyou/sheet/115231/), besides an ugly AF custom "Big Blue" (I am no artist and I spent way too long on it).

Music is "Fluffing a Duck" by Kevin Macleod, found [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQjAF3frudY).

Background image is stolen [from here](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b2/2a/a2/b22aa22b2f3f55b6468361158d52e2e7.gif).
