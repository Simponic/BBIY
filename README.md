# BBIY (Big Blue Is You)

It's like Baba is You, but Aggies (and not as good :P)

Most artwork is from the initial game, as found [here](https://www.spriters-resource.com/pc_computer/babaisyou/sheet/115231/), besides an ugly AF custom "Big Blue" (I am no artist and I spent way too long on it).

Music is "Hope is Not Lost" by Jim Hall, found on [free music archive](https://freemusicarchive.org/music/jim-hall/synth-kid-elsewhere/hope-is-not-lost) and cut just a little early to loop better.
